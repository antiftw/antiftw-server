## Instructions

This repo contains the following `docker-compose.yml` fiiles to Dockerize my AntiFTW.nl server setup:

- `baikal/docker-compose.yml` - Card/Caldav server
- `caddy/docker-compose.yml` - Caddy Docker Proxy serving as reverse proxy
- `mailserver/docker-compose.yml` - Postfix Dovecot Emailserver (*)

(*) This will be downloaded when running `./mailserver/setup`, since it comes from a separate repository and needs some configuration. 

### Initial setup

Hence, first we need to run setup the mailserver:

```bash
cd mailserver
./setup mail.example.com [options]
```
The most important options will be shortly explained in this document. But for more information on the all available options and their usage run:

```bash
./setup --help
```
Then we need to create an external network so that Caddy can manage it:

```bash
docker network create caddy
```
And finally we can spin up the network by starting the different compose files in the seperate directories
```bash
docker compose -f caddy/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker compose -f baikal/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker compose -f mailserver/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### TLS

When running the `./setup` command, using the `-tls=` option we can indicate that you want to activate TLS (**strongly** recommended for a production environment), and select the method you would like to use. 

The currently supported options are:

- LetsEncrypt (le)
- CaddyServer (le-caddy)
- Self-signed (ss) (**NOT** recommended for production servers)

#### LetsEncrypt

Using this method you will have to manage and renew your certificates yourself. Create the certificates using Certbot, and the script will configure `docker-compose.yml` such that they are mounted such that they are available to DMS.

#### CaddyServer

This will configure CaddyServer (in this case the Caddy Docker Proxy server) in such a way so that it automatically generates certificates when starting the container for the first time. It will also renew them when necessary. This is the recommended setup.

⚠️ **Important** ⚠️ 

Due to some idiosyncrasy with Docker - where it will create new directories when mounting a non-existant file - in combination with the way CaddyServer generates the certificates, the script configures `docker-compose.yml` in such a way so that it **DOES NOT** mount the certificate files. 

So: we boot DMS the first time without these mounts, so that CaddyServer recognizes the domain and generates the certificate. After this, we need to shutdown DMS, and uncomment the lines beneath `# SSL_MOUNT` so that the certificate- and keyfile are mounted inside the container.

⚠️ **Important** ⚠️ 

#### Self-signed

**Warning:** Should only be used for testing and **NEVER** on a production envrironment. Therefore there is no automation. Instructions can be found in the documentation (See `TLS` in the [references](#references))

### SpamAssassin and Fail2Ban

These can be enabled when running the `./setup` command using either the `-sa` and `-f2b` options respectively. No further action is required to activate these services.

However, these can require addition configuration depending on your requirements. More information can be found in the [Fail2Ban](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/latest/config/security/fail2ban/) and [SpamAssassin](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/latest/faq/#spamassasin) docs.

### Docker Mail Server (DMS)

The mailserver requires some additional configuration. The most important steps are described in this document. To simplify setup, there is a setup command included with DMS. More information about its functionality can be found using:

```docker exec -it mailserver setup help```

The main things we want to setup are:

- Create at least one emailaddress using:

   ```docker exec -ti mailserver setup email add admin@example.com```
- Create at least one alias using:

	```docker exec -ti mailserver setup alias add postmaster@example.com admin@example.com```
- Setup DKIM, DMARC and SPF. More about this is the next sections.

#### DKIM
- Setting up DKIM (DomainKeys Identified mail) is pretty straightforward.

First we run 

```docker exec -ti mailserver setup config dkim```

And then we add the generated record to our domains DNS, located in: 

```./docker-data/dms/config/opendkim/keys/example.com/mail.txt```

For more information about the available options from the command we can use:

```docker exec -ti mailserver setup config dkim help```

#### DMARC

Since DMS is pre-configured with DMARC out of the box, this only consists of adding a DNS record. Something like this is a good initial record:

```_dmarc.example.com. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=none; sp=none; fo=0; adkim=4; aspf=r; pct=100; rf=afrf; ri=86400; rua=mailto:dmarc.report@example.com; ruf=mailto:dmarc.report@example.com"```

### SPF

This also only entails adding a DNS record, something like: 

```v=spf1 ip4:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ip6:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx ~all```

Where we replace the ip addresses with the addresses from our server.
