# Custom Caddyfile for external proxies
# This file is merged with the auto-generated config from caddy-docker-proxy
#
# Pi5 acts as the main gateway, forwarding specific domains to Pi4 for testing

# Proxy mercure.dst-connect.io to Pi4 (192.168.50.97)
# Pi5 terminates TLS, forwards HTTP to Pi4
mercure.dst-connect.io {
    reverse_proxy 192.168.50.97:80
}

# Add additional external proxies below as needed
# Example:
# another-domain.dst-connect.io {
#     reverse_proxy 192.168.50.97:80
# }
